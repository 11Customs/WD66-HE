# WD66-HE

---
Early ideas:

- Make it work with Leopold 660 series
- Some daughter board implementation. Options:
  - [HE 60 Implementation](https://github.com/peppapighs/HE60) (JST + Type C spot on the board) *have no idea what daughterboard is advised to use*
  - Snap-out daughterboard. Problem: non-reversible
- libHMK & HMKconf support
- Same layout options as old [WD66](https://github.com/11Customs/WD66-ver-0.1) if possible
- Injection mold case/ 3d-printed case for the **light** and **DIY** options. Refer to the design proto file
- CNC case for the **plus** option
- Optional switch for user profiles (2-3 should be enough)
- Cross-compatibility with RMK & QMK if possible, *just keymaps to begin with*

All new hall-effect version of WD66 keyboard.
